## Description

This RNN learns data from `dataset_train` which contains 5 years of Google 
stock prices and predicts the next X number of days based on `timesteps` variable.

You can use and improve this code freely.

Improvements

- RNN Optimization (more layers, better hyperparameters, more epochs, etc...)

- Get more and newer data from yahoo finance or other finance sources
